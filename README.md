dApps are run on a **blockchain** network in a public, open-source, decentralized environment and are free from control and interference by any single authority (what i mean: the twitter -X- runs on a computer system that is owned by the company No matter how many users there are, the backend is controlled by the company.). For example, a developer can create a X-like dApp and put it on a blockchain where any user can publish messages. Once posted, no one—not even the app creators—can delete the messages.
