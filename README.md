# Dapp with React

## What is Dapp ?

Decentralized Applications abbreviation `Dapp` are software programs that run on a blockchain or peer to peer (P2P) network of computers instead of single computer.
Instead of operating under the control of a single authority, dApps are spread across the network to be collectively controlled by its users.
they used for a variety of purposes including gaming, finance, and social media.

so Remember this :

- dApps are digital applications that run on a blockchain network of computers instead of relying on a single computer.
- dApps are free from the control and interference of a single authority.
- Potential drawbacks include an inability to scale, challenges in developing a user interface, and difficulties in making code modifications.
- The benefits of dApps include the safeguarding of user privacy, the lack of censorship, and the flexibility of development.

dApps are run on a **blockchain** network in a public, open-source, decentralized environment and are free from control and interference by any single authority (what i mean: the twitter -X- runs on a computer system that is owned by the company No matter how many users there are, the backend is controlled by the company.). For example, a developer can create a X-like dApp and put it on a blockchain where any user can publish messages. Once posted, no one—not even the app creators—can delete the messages.

## What we must know before developing a Dapp ?

Because dApps operate on decentralized networks, there is no need for an intermediary
This can lead to reduced costs, increased efficiency, and greater accessibility.

DApps are accessible to anyone with an internet connection. It doesn't matter where you live - you just need to be able to hop online to access many dApps. This global accessibility democratizes access to so many different types of services, digital assets, and information. This is what makes dApps so important: also anyone can use them, meaning so many new opportunities can be opened up by dApps.

Blockchain-based dApps maintain transparent records of transactions, meaning users can verify the integrity of data without relying on centralized authorities. This transparency can foster trust among users, and it makes it more difficult for network users to be censored. This is one of the main advantages we'll talk about later.

## where we gonna use Dapps (Use cases)?

- **Financial services**: dApps can be used to facilitate peer-to-peer financial transactions, such as the exchange of currencies or the transfer of assets.

- **Supply chain management**: dApps can be used to track the movement of goods through a supply chain, ensuring transparency and accountability.

- **identity verification**: dApps can be used to securely store and verify identity information, such as for voter rolls or passport applications.

- **Social media**: dApps can be used to create decentralized social media platforms, allowing users to interact and share content without the need for a central authority.

- and so on...

## Pros and Cons of Dapps

### Pros

- Resists censorship
- Flexible platform enables dApp development
- Promotes user privacy

### Cons

- Experimental, may not be able to scale
- Challenges in developing a user-friendly interface
- Difficult to make needed code modifications

## What are Ethereum Dapps ?

These are decentralized applications that are developed using the Ethereum platform and are powered by it. Ethereum dApps use smart contracts for their logic. They are deployed on the Ethereum network and use the platform's blockchain for data storage.
